     <h2>Okapi</h2>
      <h3>A MOST CURIOUS ANIMAL, A CULTURAL SYMBOL, A SPECIES ON THE BRINK </h3>  <tab> The okapi — Okapia johnstoni; the “forest giraffe”; one of the oldest mammals left on Earth — is known to the western world only since the early 20th century. Shy and elusive as it is serene and gentle, with remarkable natural defenses against predation (not least of which, its extraordinary markings), the okapi is nearly impossible to observe in the wild. To the Democratic Republic of Congo, to which it is uniquely endemic, it is a national and cultural symbol, and has been protected since 1933. It is also a species whose existence is under grave threat from the impact of human activities.The okapi is entirely dependent on the forest sanctuary for its survival, and deforestation, along with poaching and mining, have led to its precipitous and perilous decline. </div>
    <div> <br> An Okapi Conservation Strategy Workshop (2013) found that the population had plummeted over 50% in just three generations (about 15 years). Based on the findings of the workshop, the okapi were officially classified ‘Endangered’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species — up sharply from its original Red List classification of ‘Near Threatened’. Okapi Conservation Project works with ICCN and communities throughout the Okapi Wildlife Reserve — a 13,700-sq-km swathe of the Ituri Forest in northeastern DRC — to ensure the protection of the okapi and many other species in this equatorial rainforest. Key to this are conservation initiatives that benefit the livelihoods and environment of the okapi’s human cohabitants. The OCP relies heavily on zoos around the globe to educate the international public about this unique, captivating creature and the importance of its rainforest habitat.</br> </div>

    <h2>Reserve</h2> <h3>THE GREATEST MARVELS OF AFRICA</h3> 
    <div class="columns_2"> <p>So proclaimed the Welsh explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley when, in 1888, he led the first expedition across the forests of the northern Congo. Indeed, The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the most biologically diverse country in Africa, holds infinite natural treasures and significant species such as gorilla, elephant and bonobo. Over 1,500 types of plants and animals, including the okapi, are found only here in the world. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve, established in 1992 and listed as a World Heritage Site in 1996, helps protect the habitat of the okapi and preserve rare plant and animal life, as well as the lifestyle and culture of indigenous people. The Reserve encompasses 13,700 square kilometers (1.5 times the area of Yellowstone National Park) of the Ituri Forest – one of the most important centers of plant and animal diversity in Africa – in the northeastern portion of the DRC. The largest population of okapi, forest elephants and chimpanzees in DRC, along with 13 species of primates, leopard, forest buffalo, bongo antelope, water chevrotain, and a wide variety of birds and insects, are among the wildlife harbored in the Reserve.</div>
<div class="columns_2">The Ituri Forest is also the cultural center of the Mbuti and Efe pygmies, among the last true “forest people” left on Earth. They are true hunter-gatherers and deep forest-dwellers living traditional lifestyles as they have for centuries, perhaps millennia. Through trade and association with neighboring cultivation communities like the Bantu, their activities generally enrich the overall composition of the forest by providing pockets of secondary vegetation a source of plants on which the okapi feed. The Okapi Conservation Project’s presence in the region and its role as a coordinator and supporter of the Reserve has helped to provide stability for the Mbuti and Efe pygmies to continue to live off the bounty of the forest as they have for thousands of years. The Epulu Station, in its namesake northeastern DRC village, is headquarters for ICCN and the base of operations for OCP personnel. From here, ICCN, with OCP support, monitor and manage the Reserve. OCP activities radiate out from Epulu to support the neighboring communities and towns in and around the Reserve.</div>

   <h2>Okapi Day</h2> 
    <div class="columns_2"> On October 18, 2016 Join us as we celebrate the inaugural World Okapi Day! The elusive okapi is a mysterious and secretive mammal that is nearly impossible to observe in the wild. Commonly mistaken as a hybrid between 2 or 3 animals, the okapi is its very own distinct species living in the spectacular, lush rainforests of central Africa. Its existence is under serious threat from the impact of human activities. The okapi is entirely dependent on the forest sanctuary for its survival, and deforestation, along with poaching and mining, has contributed to its precipitous decline in recent decades. Remaining unknown to the western world until 1901, the okapi is a cultural symbol in the Congo, and is considered an umbrella species for the immense biodiversity in the area – protecting the okapi means protecting all other species found in its habitat, including elephants, chimpanzees and gorillas. Most people have never heard about the okapi, which is why we created a World Okapi Day – to help bring awareness to this endangered species, to share ways we’re helping protect this animal and to show how you can help too.</div>
<div class="columns_2">Ways you can help save okapi: Visit your nearest zoo or okapi holding facility. See our list of partners and supporters in North America, Europe and Asia here. Tell your family and friends about the okapi. Recycle your old cell phones – they contain coltan a mineral mined in the forests of DRC. Recycling your phones means less mining in the forest. Post your best okapi photos on social media and use the hashtags #OkapiConservation and #WorldOkapiDay on all your okapi-related posts. Change your social media cover photo to one of the options found on our Facebook page. Give a $10 gift (or more) to the Okapi Conservation Project by visiting by clicking here. One hundred percent of the proceeds go to help protect okapi and its habitat. Host your own okapi awareness event! Get creative! And be sure to share with us what you did! Take photos and email them to lmeers@okapiconservation.org and you may be featured on our social media channels!</div>
